        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>As we know, the concept of the Oneness of Allah formed the basis of the mission of our beloved Prophet, Muhammad bin Abdullah(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and this noble mission is in fact a continuation of the mission of the Prophet who preceded him, as stated by Allah in the Noble Qur'an:
            All praise is due to Allah
            and may peace and blessings
            be upon the Prophet of Allah:</p>

                <i>" And Verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a messenger (proclaiming): 'worship Allah (alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities etc.).' "</i>

        (This tradition has also been reported by Al-Bukhari on the authority of Abu Hurairah.)
        In summary, from these articles of faith emanate all that a Muslim should believe regarding Allah's right the Day of Judgement and all matters partaining to the unseen world.</p>
        <h3> 1. Belief in Allah</h3>
        <p>True belief in Allah implies that Allah is the True God who alone deserves to be worshipped, as He is the Creator and Sustainer of human beings. It also necessitates the belief that Allah is fully aware of every human, and He is able to reward the righteous, and punish the disobedient. In fact, Allah created mankind and jinn for the sole reason of worshipping him alone. As the Qur'an says:</p>

            <i>"And we did not send any Messenger before you except that We revealed to himthat, 'There is no deity except Me, so Worship Me."</i>
        </fieldset>
        <hr />
        <h3>2. Belief in the Angels</h3>
        <p>A Muslim should believe in all of. Allah's angels, whom He created to worship Him, and  whom He describes as "honored slaves." The Qur'an says, about the Angels:</p>
        <code>******************21:28</code>

            <i>A Muslim should believe in all of. Allah's angels, whom He created to worship Him, and  whom He describes as "honored slaves." The Qur'an says, about the Angels:</i>
        </fieldset><br>
        <p><strong>__angels fall into different categories, and they are assigned different duties__!!!</strong></p><br>
        <h4>Ahadith from Aisha(pbuh)</h4>
        <p><sub>Malik, Malik (the guardian of Hellfire), and Israfil (the blower of the trumpet), may peace be upon them all. Aisha reported that the Prophet (pbuh) said:</sub></p>
        <p><sup><i>**the Angels were created from light; the jinns were created from a smokeless flame of fire, and Adam was created from what has been describe to you**(Muslim)</i></sup></p>
        <hr />
        <h3>3. Belief in the Books</h3>
        <p>A Muslim must believe that Allah has sent down books upon His Messengers to clarify His right and to call it, as Allah says in the Qur'an:</p>
        <code>*******************57:25</code>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Translation</legend>
            <i>" indeed, We have sent messengers with clear proofs, and sent down with them the scripture and the balance (justice) so that the people may maintain (their affairs) in justice."</i>
        </fieldset><br />
        <p><strong>__Among the books that we, as Muslims, believe in are the revealed books that Allah named, such as the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, and the Qur'an. The Glorious Qur'an is the final and the best of these books!!!.__</strong></p>
        <hr />
        <h3>4. Belief in the messengers...................</h3>
        <hr />
        <h3>4. Belief in the Last Day</h3>
        <p>Belief in the Last Day includes the belief in all that will happen after death, based on that which Allah and His Messengers have informed. This includes the trial in the grave, and the torment or the bliss therein. As well it includes the belief in all that will be witnessed on the Day of Judgement, such as the bridge set over the Hell-fire, the balance (of deeds), the reckoning, the reward and punishment, and the records of all our deeds As clearly mentioned in the Qur'an, and authentically reported from the Prophet (pbuh).</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>6. Belief in the Divine Destiny</h3>
        <p>Belief in qadar, or Divine Destiny, is comprised of four points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the belief that Allah knows all what has been and what will be. He is aware of everything concerning His slaves. He knows their provisions and sustenance, their appointed terms on Earth, their deeds, and everything else related to them. Nothing is hidden from Allah as the Noble Qur'an says:</li>
            <code>*************"***58:7</code>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Translation</legend>
                <i>"... Verily, Allah is the All-knower of everything."</i>
            </fieldset>
            <hr />
            <li>Second, the belief that Allah the Almighty keeps all that He decrees in a Clear Book or Al-Lauh Al-Mahfudh, as is mentioned in the Noble Qur'an:</li>
            <code>*******************50:4</code>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Translation</legend>
                <i>"We know what the earth takes of them (i.e their dead bodies), and with Us is a book preserved (i.e the book of decrees)."</i>
            </fieldset>
            <li>Third, the belief that Allah's will is absolutely and powerful, and that whatever He decrees will be, and whatever He does not decree will never come to pass.</li>
            <code>********************22:18</code>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Translation</legend>
                <i>"... Verily, Allah does what He wills"
                </i>
            </fieldset>
            <li>Fourth, the belief that Allah is the Sole Creator  of all things, as Allah says in the Qur'an:</li>
            <code>*******************39:62</code>
            <fieldset>
                <legend>Translation</legend>
                <i>"Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian of and Disposer of all affairs."</i>
            </fieldset>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>
            ...Belief in the Divine Destiny is composed of all these four categories that have just been mentioned. This is the position of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-jama'ah and only those who yield to innovations in religion will deny some of these categories...
